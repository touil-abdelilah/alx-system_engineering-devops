# Web Stack Documentation

## Overview
Provide a brief overview of the web stack, including its purpose and key components.

### Purpose
Explain the purpose of the web stack and its role in supporting web applications.

### Components
List the main components of the web stack, such as:
- Load Balancer
- Web Servers
- Database Servers
- Application Servers
- Caching Layer
- Monitoring Tools

## Components

### Load Balancer
Describe the load balancer component, including its role, configuration, and redundancy measures.

### Web Servers
Explain the role of web servers in serving web pages and handling HTTP requests. Describe the configuration and redundancy measures for web servers.

### Database Servers
Detail the database servers' role in storing and managing application data. Discuss database replication, clustering, or sharding techniques for redundancy.

### Application Servers
Describe the application servers' role in executing application logic and interacting with the database. Discuss redundancy measures for application servers.

### Caching Layer
Explain the caching layer's role in improving application performance and reducing database load. Describe cache replication or clustering for redundancy.

### Monitoring Tools
Detail the monitoring tools used to monitor server, service, and application health and performance. Discuss redundancy measures for monitoring.

## Redundancy Measures
Explain the redundancy measures implemented in the web stack to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

### Load Balancer Redundancy
Describe the load balancer redundancy configuration, such as active-passive or active-active setups.

### Server Redundancy
Discuss redundancy measures for web servers, database servers, and application servers.

### Data Redundancy
Explain database replication, clustering, or sharding techniques for ensuring data redundancy and availability.

### Failover Mechanisms
Describe failover mechanisms implemented to redirect traffic or switch to backup resources in case of component failure.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points of the web stack documentation and emphasize the importance of redundancy measures for maintaining a robust and highly available infrastructure.
