Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!

Requirements:

Install nginx on your web-01
server
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx
Server terminal:

root@sy-web-01$ ./1-install_nginx_web_server > /dev/null 2>&1
root@sy-web-01$ 
root@sy-web-01$ curl localhost
Hello World!
root@sy-web-01$ 
Local terminal:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl 34.198.248.145/
Hello World!
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

In this example 34.198.248.145 is the IP of my web-01 server. If you want to query the Nginx that is locally installed on your server, you can use curl 127.0.0.1.

If things are not going as expected, make sure to check out Nginx logs, they can be found in /var/log/.

Maarten’s PRO-tip: When you use sudo su on your web-01 you can become root like this to test your file:

sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo su
root@ubuntu#
